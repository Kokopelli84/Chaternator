# Chat server DB

This project is a full stack chat applications for multiple users developed during the junior part of the Codeworks bootcamp. There are two versions for the backend; one running with Sequelize and Postgres and a second with Mongoose and MongoDB. Both will work seamlessly with the same client.

## Getting started

The following npm commands will start the server:

Mongoose Backend: `npm run mongoose`
Sequelize Backend: `npm run sequelize`

There is also a docker-compose file that will start up a postgres database. To start it you need to have Docker installed and run `npm run start-docker`.
